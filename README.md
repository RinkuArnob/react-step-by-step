Let us first build the TODO app with jQuery. Take a look at `src/views/vanilla.ejs` and `src/js/vanilla.js`. Play with the app in your browser at [http://localhost:8000/vanilla]([http://localhost:8000/vanilla]).

The TODO app we are going to build has the following features:
- add new todo
- check / uncheck todos
- switch between tabs to filter the todos
- remove added todos

In this tutorial, we are going to re-implement this app using React.
