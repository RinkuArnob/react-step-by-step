## Step 1
> In this step: routing, hello world react component

Get started by first creating a routing `/react` to our newly react implementation in `src/index.js`. This part of the code can be different for different routing solution or even avoided if you don't need the routing. You can just skip this part if you cannot understand the code and just move on, it will not affect any of the steps later on.

Next, we have to create a **container** for our React component, we can simply do it by creating a `<div />` with `id` of `root` in `src/views/react.ejs`.

In the main entry of our app, take a look at `src/js/react.js`. All the magics will happen in this place, including all the UI, styles and logic.

Go ahead check out the code and read the comment. Try to make some modification and look into your browser. When you're done, go to the next step.
